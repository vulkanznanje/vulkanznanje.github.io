## Social Media Botting/Listening

- [**Vitaminst, Instagram bot**](https://rafaelcartenet.github.io/Instagram-Botting/): I created a smart instagram bot able to target with high precision posts and create relevant comment in order to generate a feedback. Up to 250 new followers per day, deployed on 5 Raspberry Pi 3.
- **CredTracker** (On going): I want to create a simple automation tool that would estimate one's population based on tweets over time, and backtest it with official polls.

## Retail

- **Wifi-based flow analysis** (Company project): Designed and implemented a solution to collect, enrich and aggregate wifi location data in order to give insights to retail owners about key indicators such as, shops' attractiveness, customers' habits, live flows.
- **Shopping mall affluence prediction** (Company project): Tested different LSTM classification models in order to predict the number of distinct customers of a shopping mall for a given day. Integrated OpenData features such as weather (+ weather forecast), public holidays, shopping mall events.

## IOT

- **Building hypervisor** (Company project): Designed and implemented IOT data collection worfklow + exposition worfklow in order to demonstrate key indicators for buildings owners, occupation / comfort / energy consumption etc..

## Advanced Algorithms

- [**Monte Carlo Tree Search applied to Alpha-Go**](https://github.com/RafaelCartenet/MonteCarloTreeSearchAlphaGo): Implemented simple MCTS algorithm and adapted it for "mini Alpha-Go" version.
- [**Optimized STMVN**](https://github.com/RafaelCartenet/MFCC_STMVN): Optimized normalization technique for sequential data.
- [**Sequences Matcher**](https://github.com/RafaelCartenet/SequenceMatcher): Dynamic Programming based sequence matching tool.
- [**Advanced algorithms implementation**](https://github.com/RafaelCartenet/Advanced-Algorithms): Several implementations: Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory etc.
